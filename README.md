This repository demonstrates a common error when using Firebase's Firestore: attempting to access a document snapshot's data before it has fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.  The problem arises from asynchronous operations; the solution involves using promises or async/await to ensure the data is available before access.
