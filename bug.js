The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This can happen if you're using asynchronous operations, such as promises or async/await, and you try to access the data before the promise resolves. For example, if you have a function that retrieves a document from Firestore, and then tries to log the document's data immediately, the data might not be available yet, resulting in an error.
